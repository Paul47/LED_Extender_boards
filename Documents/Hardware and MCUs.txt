## Which MCU should you use?

Driving large led arrays or long strips requires a lot of on-board memory and processing speed.
8-bit MCUs like the UNO will propably not work well if at all. 32 bit MCUs are preferred.

Tested MCUs
Teensy 3.5, 3.5, 4.0 qnd 4.1
ESP32
Adafruit Matrix Portal M4 (see pin details below)
STM32

See the wiring recommenations below for starting

## Teensy 3.5 to 4.1 

============ To properly function with the Teensy you MUST define the follwoing ==================
#define FASTLED_TEENSY3 //no teensy4 enabled for DATA_RATE_MHZ()
   or
#define FASTLED_TEENSY4 //defined for DATA_RATE_MHZ() and FAST_SPI in fastSPI_ARM_MXRT1062.h

### Teensy SPI pins for 2-wire leds

Any Teensy ouput pins should work for driving led strips or array panels. Even the 2-wire
DATA+CLOCK can be any pair of pins, since the led clock is not related to the MCU clock. 

Teensy 4.1 hardware SPI - this MCU has 2 sets of SPI ports.
These may deliver faster display rates.
         Teensy SPI pin
DATA_1   11
CLOCK_1  13
DATA_2   26
CLOCK_2  27
  
If you are NOT using the LEDS Extender Shields, but want to use up to 4 separate led strips, 
set HAS_EXTENDER (below) to true, set the Banks = 1, and the NUM_STRIPS to your strips (1 to 4). 
Be sure to assign the DATA or DATA/CLOCK  pins correctly. 

### Teensy SPI pins for 1-wire leds

For 1-wire led strips Teensy boards limit the useable pins. 
For 1-wire leds, it appears that only some Teensy pins will work as DATA lines.
Usable pins: 
Teensy LC:   1, 4, 5, 24 
Teensy 3.2:  1, 5, 8, 10, 31   (overclock to 120 MHz for pin 8) 
Teensy 3.5:  1, 5, 8, 10, 26, 32, 33, 48 
Teensy 3.6:  1, 5, 8, 10, 26, 32, 33 
Teensy 4.0:  1, 8, 14, 17, 20, 24, 29, 39
Teensy 4.1:  1, 8, 14, 17, 20, 24, 29, 35, 47, 53

## Dr. Oldies LED Extender shield and boards. 

For 2-wire leds, select your DATA/CLOCK pins
If using the Extender shield pin selections are limited to these:
         Teensy pin
DATA_1   1    or    14**
CLOCK_1  2    or    15**
DATA_2   3    or    16**
CLOCK_2  4    or    17**
**If Teensy is rotated 180 deg on the Extender board


## Adafruit MatrixPortal M4

This portal MCU board was designed for HUB75 led panels but can be used for 
1-wire and 2-wire led strips and panels as well. Here is the output pin
number for the board's connector.

Insert jumpers in the top 2x8 side of the connector, or the 2x10 bottom side.
Be sure to skip the left and right most pins on the bootom side of the connector.

Connector: 2x8 pins on top, 2x10 on bottom.

## Wiring Recommenations

* while some leds can be driven with 3.3v directly from the MCU, 5v is highly recommended.
The voltage drop along a string can drop the voltage well below the 3v3 level causing breakup.
* Voltage injection is adding additional power along the led string. This can be at the end
of each strip, or anywhere along the strip.With tiled led blocks, I add power to each tile.
* 1.0uf, 16v or 24v - You sould use this on each power line across Vdd and GND, as close to the
first led in the string as possible. If using power injection, a cap shoul be across every line.
* 0.1uf,16v \ - Some led strips and tiles have o.1uf capacitors across Vdd and GND at each led. I
have not found this necessary using a good power supply, heavy wire (22 awg or lower gauge).
* 22, 20 awg jumper wiring. even heavier for 5v and ground. Most jumper wires (those ribbons yop
pull strips off of) are 24 or even 26 awg. These are too thin for led arrays, especially if
the are more then 15cm long. 
* Brightness can be a problem with many leds that can affect your eyes. Keep the brightness low
and add a paper filter or fronsted plastic panel - even when just testing your project.
